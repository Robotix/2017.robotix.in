Q: How do I register for the event? 

```
Registration for the events has to be done from Kshitijâ€™s 
website. For the exact procedure, check www.ktj.in
```

Q: Is there any abstract submission for the event? 

```
No abstract submission is required.
```

Q: How many members can be there in a team?

```
Each team can have a maximum of four members.
```

Q: Do I need to bring my own marker during the event?

```
No it is not required. We will provide you with a marker.
You can also bring your own markers to localize your robots.
```

Q: Will I be given time for thresholding (localization etc) before a run?

```
Yes. You will be given sufficient time before a run (~20 mins) to 
make thresholding changes.
```

Q: Is hard coding allowed?

```
NO! We will check your codes before your run. If hard coding is 
detected, your run will not be considered.
```

Q: Do I have to make the robot wired / wireless?

```
It is your choice. Both are allowed. In case you are making a wired robot, 
we will be providing you with USB extenders.
```

Q: What is the model of the overhead camera?

```
Logitech B910 HD Webcam / Genius WideCam F100
```

Q: How will we threshold the colours?

```
You can easily create a sample image in Paint or just use the image provided
in the arena. It would be preferable to use trackbars so that you can easily
adjust the threshold. The actual thresholding can be done on-site so as to
get an accurate judgement of all the range according to the lighting condition
present there.
```

Q: How exactly will the video feed reach the bot?

```
We will have a USB 2.0 cable of the camera which can go into your laptop's
port.
```

Q: Can the bot be wireless?

```
Yes the bot can be controlled without a wire by Bluetooth, WiFi, XeeBee, or
any other stuff but the participant has to declare what she will be using
during the run.
```

Q: What will be the resolution of the video feed?

```
We have provided the model of the camera ie. Logitech B910 HD webcam /
Genius WideCam F100.
```
Q: How much time will we get between Round 1 and Round 2?

```
Unfortunately, we cannot comment on that right now because it all depends on
how many participants successfully complete the round. If all participants
manage to complete the round within the first 6 hours, then we will give more
than 24 hours to prepare for round 2 but the chances of this are highly
unlikely as based on our previous experiences. But at a minimum, we will give
approximately 8 hours in between. Also note, it is probable that if extremely
few participants are able to complete Round 1 then there might not be a
Round 2.
```

Q: What is the role of the marker?

```
The marker is used to get the information of the bot. You can easily get the
center of the head and tail. With this information, you can locate the center
of the bot as well as the direction of the bot.
```

Q: Some triangles/squares are in groups, does it mean that they are same?

```
No! Each resource is individual and different.
