#### Introduction

The Bomb Squad is to try out their new robot which can disarm bombs and thus
reduce the loss of lives of the fearless men who try to diffuse it.

#### USP

* **Land traversal**

* **Cutting wires**

* **Lifting objects**

#### Problem statement

To build a manually controlled robot which is capable of cutting the
required wires and lifting objects.

#### Rounds

##### Round 1

* Traverse through an obstacle path and search for bombs (wooden blocks).

* Each bomb will have a colour code indicating the time the bomb will explode after the event starts.

* Each bomb will have a wire on them. Diffuse the bombs by cutting the wire.

* Any bomb can be dropped at most once while traversal, however it will incur negative points. If a bomb is dropped twice, the bomb will be considered exploded.

* There will be bonus bombs that can be attempted only after all the bombs have either been diffused or have blasted.

* Bonus bomb will have no negative points upon explosion.

* There will a sound to indicate the bomb blast (Dropping case excluded, only when timer goes off).

* The bot can defuse the bomb in the city limits itself instead of taking it to safe zone but it will cost him more negative points if it explodes in city limits.

* This round will last for 3 minutes.

##### Round 2

* Traverse through an obstacle path and search for bombs (wooden blocks)

* Each bomb will have a colour code indicating the time the bomb will explode after the event starts.

* Each bomb will have 2 wires on them. Diffuse the bombs by cutting the wire asked to cut at the time of the run.

* Any bomb can be dropped at most once while traversal, however it will incur negative points. If a bomb is dropped twice, the bomb will be considered exploded.

* There will be tanks of fossil fuel around the city. While traversing through the arena you have to ensure that you don’t touch or drop these tanks. If touched or dropped, negative points will be given.

* There will be bonus bombs that can be attempted only after all the bombs have either been diffused or have blasted.

* Bonus bomb will have no negative points.

* For the concentrated area, once the robot crosses the marked line it will have only 30 secs to attempt the bomb. 

* There will a sound to indicate the bomb blast ( Dropping case excluded, only when timer goes off )

* The bot can defuse the bomb in the city limits itself instead of taking it to safe zone but it will cost him more negative points if it explodes in city limits.

* This round will last for 5 minutes.

##### Round 3

* The task for this round will be declared at the time of the event.

* No extra mechanical changes will be required or accepted for the bot.

#### Arena

![](/img/event/bombdisposal/hangerFront.PNG){:.img-responsive}

**Barriers(Rubber Bands)**:

Along its path, the robot will have to get past through few barriers (in the form of stretched rubber bands) by cutting through it with its mechanism or else avoiding it altogether.

* There are going to be 2 sizes of bombs.

* One set will be wooden cubes of dimension **5 cm * 5 cm * 5 cm** (`l*b*h`).

* Another set will be wooden cubes of dimension **3 cm * 3 cm * 3 cm** (`l*b*h`).

* Wire will be attached to the upper surface (lower surface for the hanging bomb) of the bomb.

* The wire will be made up of stretched rubber band

* The hanging bomb will have a hook on top surface for the corresponding lifting mechanism.

* The weight of the object will be **less than** **90 g**

**Petrol Tank Specification:**

* These will be cylinders of suitable dimensions.

* The weight of the object will be **less than** **50 g**.


#### Rules And Specifications

##### General Rules

* All arena dimensions may have a tolerance (error) of up to 10%.

* Each team can consist of a maximum of 4 members.

* Only **2** members per team will be allowed to control the robot.

* The participants will be provided with 220 volts, 50 Hz standard AC supply.

* Each team should have unique participants i.e. no two teams can have even a single participant common.

* The team members can be from different institutes or colleges.

* Teams qualifying the first round will go into the second round. Those qualifying second round will participate in third round which will determine the winner.

* The teams cannot touch their bots during the course of the run, unless timeout is taken.

* The right spirit of participation is expected from the participants.

* **The decision of Team ROBOTIX will be final and binding.**

##### Event Rules

###### Bomb

* The Bombs will be made of Hollow wood.

* The tolerances in all dimensions are 10%.

* The weight of the bomb will not exceed 90 gms.

* The position of all the bomb will be decided by Team ROBOTIX.

###### Picking and placing up the Bomb

* The bombs have to be picked up as **neatly** as possible and dragging must be avoided if possible.

* If the bomb falls down once during traversal, there will be negative points. However, if it falls down again then it will lead to an explosion.

###### Arena and Locomotion

* The robot has to start from the **Safe Zone,** which will be marked in green in the arena.

* The bot has to go and complete the tasks as specified above. Any discrepancies will be handled by Team ROBOTIX and their decision will be final and binding.

* Time will be kept by Team ROBOTIX and their decision will be final and binding.

###### Initial Orientation of Robot

* The participant is allowed to decide the initial orientation of his robot on the start zone.

* Team ROBOTIX reserves the right to disallow any initial orientation of the robot inside the starting zone if it gives the participant an undue advantage, solely based on the judge’s discretion.

###### Restarts and Timeouts

* A maximum of 2 Timeouts of **1 minute** each may be taken in each round. Penalty will be awarded for each timeout and robot will start from its last position on the arena.

* The participant’s robots can have a maximum of 1 restart per round. A penalty will be imposed on the team for every restart that they take.

* After the restart, the participant’s robot will be set to its initial position. Timer will be set to zero and the run will start afresh with the addition of the penalty for restart.

* A timeout can be taken anytime at the user's discretion.

* A restart can only be taken if there is a genuine technical fault in the bot. Team ROBOTIX may refuse a restart if the reason is not genuine, and their decision will be binding and final.

##### Robot Specifications

* Each robot can have maximum dimension of 30 x 30 x 30 cubic cm (L x B x H) respectively.

* No part/mechanism of/on the robot should exceed the given dimensions before the commencement of the event run. The robots can exceed their respective dimensions once the event commences, due to elongation of arms/gripper/forklift.

* There is no weight restriction on the robot.

* LEGO kits or its spare parts or pre-made mechanical parts are not allowed.[ (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstorms)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstorms)

* Ready-made gearboxes, sensors, development boards can be used but no other part of the robot should contain any ready-made components. Simple car bases with no extra features may be used.

* The bots should not damage the event arena in any way. If it does so, a penalty will be imposed on the team. The magnitude of the penalty will be decided by Team ROBOTIX.

* Ready-made gripper is also allowed .
